# Coordinate-Calculator
*Exercise for GEOG 728 Programming for Geographic Analysis at Kansas State University

### Instructions:

Using GitHub or GitHub Desktop and an IDE of your choosing, edit the starter Python script <code>coord_calc.py</code> so that user-supplied geographic coordinates in degrees-minutes-second (DDMMSS) format are converted to decimal degrees (DD).  Make sure that your code includes the following elements, features, and/or capabilities:

1. Requests and accepts user-supplied coordinates in DDMMSS format (e.g., 391120).
2. Performs all necessary mathematical operations to convert to DD.
3. Prints the resulting DD coordinates at a floating point number along with a friendly message.
4. Includes key comments explaining what your code accomplishes.

## Submission:

Commit your code changes to your repository on GitHub.
