# Coordinate-Calculator
Exercise for GEOG 728 Programming for Geographic Analysis at Kansas State University

This is a test respository for a GitHub Classroom assignment.

Edit the starter Python script <code>coord_calc.py</code> so that includes the following features. Your script should convert user-supplied geographic coordinates in DDMMSS format to DD.

1. Requests and accepts user-supplied coordinates (e.g., 391120).
2. Performs all necessary mathematical operations to convert to DD.
3. Prints the resulting floating point number along with a message.
4. Includes comments explaining what your code accomplishes.
